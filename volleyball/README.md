### App docs

Each app (Excluding stadiums since it's pretty straightforward) has a README.md file including some explanation on it's
structured and why it's structured in that way.

Some more details are available in the code for each class and method.

### API DOC

Swagger api is available at http://127.0.0.1:8000/swagger/

**Note:**

Most of the API doc is auto generated, but it requires some manual changes and schemas to be added. I added some extras
as much as time limitation allowed me. But, there is more work to be done in terms of API documentations.

### Tests

I would've loved to add tests but there was not much time.

### API directory versioning

I added versioning for URLs, and it makes sense for the api directories to have the same versioning, but I preferred to
avoid multiple directories since there won't be any other versions. 

Basically URLs have versioning to point out the importance of the API versioning.
